My full-stack web app was created with JavaScript and React displaying a front-end and Flask serving a REST API in the back-end. It allows users to choose their favorite of two chess positions which can then search, sort, and export data to an Excel spreadsheets. Utilizing a 3rd party API, this was my first exposure to REST principles and Flask.
