My website was built with React and CSS and uses the static site generator Gatsby. The website uses Github for continuous development, and it is hosted on Netlify. The project taught me the nuances of CSS since I did not have a template, and I found that I should not underestimate any language or tool like CSS or React despite its reputation.
